# 🔐 Privacy & Security Model – Shadow Me 360

Shadow Me 360 is built on the foundation of **user sovereignty**, **local execution**, and **real encryption**.  
We believe personal data should stay personal – offline, private, and under the user's control.

---

## 🔒 1. Local-Only Architecture (Zero Cloud)

- All data is stored locally using **IndexedDB** or **SQLite via SQL.js**
- The application is installable as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** or **Electron desktop app**
- There are **no cloud dependencies**, **no telemetry**, and **no external API calls**

## 🔐 2. Encryption Strategy

| Layer             | Algorithm / Method                                | Description                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage Layer** | AES-256 or ChaCha20                                | All user data is encrypted before being saved locally       |
| **Key Derivation**| PBKDF2 with user-defined password                  | The encryption key is generated from the user's password    |
| **Client-Side**   | WebCrypto API or CryptoJS                          | All encryption/decryption happens inside the user’s device  |
| **Password**      | Never stored or transmitted                        | The user’s password is required only locally                |

## 🧠 3. Local AI Processing (WebLLM / MLC.js)

- All AI inference and prompt handling is done **on-device**
- No data is sent to OpenAI, HuggingFace, or any third-party LLM service
- Models are quantized and optimized for local inference via **WebGPU/WebAssembly**

---

## 🧪 4. Optional ZK-Proof Integration (Pro Edition)

Shadow Me 360 Pro will support **zero-knowledge proofs**, allowing users to:

- Prove statements like:
  > “I can afford 5 monthly payments of $200”  
  > without revealing their full financial data

- Technologies used:
  - [`Noir`](https://noir-lang.org/)
  - [`Circom`](https://docs.circom.io/)
  - [`snarkjs`](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)

---

## 🧳 5. Export & Portability

- Users can **export their encrypted database** as:
  - `.json` or `.db` format
  - Portable across devices
- Only the user with the correct password can decrypt and restore the data

---

## 🚫 6. What We Explicitly Avoid

- ❌ No analytics or third-party SDKs  
- ❌ No login or signup  
- ❌ No cloud sync  
- ❌ No ad tracking, fingerprinting, or background connections
