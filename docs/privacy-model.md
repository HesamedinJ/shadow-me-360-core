# 🔐 Privacy & Security Model – Shadow Me 360

Shadow Me 360 is built on the belief that **data privacy is not a feature – it’s a right**.  
Our system is designed from the ground up to run **100% offline**, without ever requiring an internet connection or sharing any data with third parties.

## 🧱 Privacy Architecture Layers

| Layer              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage**         | Data is stored locally using IndexedDB (browser) or SQLite (Electron)      |
| **Encryption**      | Full-database encryption using AES-256 or ChaCha20                         |
| **Password-based**  | User’s chosen password is used as the encryption key via PBKDF2            |
| **No Cloud**        | No servers, no sync, no telemetry, no data leaves the device               |
| **Offline AI**      | All inference is done via local LLMs running in WebAssembly / WebGPU       |
| **ZK-Proofs (Pro)** | Optional zero-knowledge proofs for advanced assertions without exposure    |

## 🔒 Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC or ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and salt
- **Key Storage**: 🔥 *Not stored anywhere* – user must enter it on each launch
- **Data at rest**: All data is encrypted before saving to disk or browser storage
- **Data in use**: Decrypted in-memory only during active session

## 📦 Local Storage Technologies

| Platform   | Engine         | Format     |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Browser    | IndexedDB      | Key-Value  |
| Electron   | SQLite (via sql.js or better-sqlite3) | Relational  |

## 🧠 AI Processing – 100% Offline

Shadow Me 360 never uses cloud-based APIs for AI processing.  
We embed **quantized lightweight LLMs** such as:

- [Phi-3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-3-open-models/),  
- [TinyLlama](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama),  
- [Mistral-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai)

These models run in-browser via:

- [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) or  
- [MLC.js](https://mlc.ai/mlcjs)

**Everything stays on the user’s machine.** No data, no queries, no logs are ever sent out.

---

## 🧪 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Advanced – Pro)

We aim to integrate ZK-proofs to allow users to **prove conditions without revealing private data**.  
For example:

> ✅ *“This user can afford 5 monthly payments of $200”*  
> 🚫 Without showing salary, transaction logs, or raw data

Planned tools:

- [Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir)
- [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)
- [zk-kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit)
- [Circom](https://docs.circom.io)

---

## 💥 No Tracking, Ever

We do **not** use:

- Google Analytics
- Error reporting tools
- Cloud sync
- IP logging
- External APIs of any kind

The philosophy is simple:  
> **If we don’t store it, we can’t leak it.**

---

## 🛡️ Trust Through Design

Shadow Me 360 is open-source and auditable.  
You can inspect every layer — from encryption to AI processing — and confirm that your data never leaves your device.

Together, we’re redefining personal AI:  
🔒 **Private by design**  
⚙️ **Local by default**  
🧠 **Smart without surveillance**
