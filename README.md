## ⚙️ Core Principles & Technology

### 1. **Local-Only Execution (Zero Cloud)**  
- All data is stored securely on your device (IndexedDB / SQLite)  
- Installs as a PWA or Electron app  
- No external API calls or cloud dependencies

### 2. **Offline AI with Lightweight LLMs**  
- Uses local models like `Phi-3`, `TinyLlama`, or `Mistral-Instruct`  
- Runs via [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) or [MLC.js](https://mlc.ai/mlcjs)  
- Enables reasoning, summaries, and simulations offline

### 3. **Real Encryption**  
- End-to-end data encryption using AES-256 or ChaCha20  
- Encrypted client-side using user-selected password (PBKDF2)  
- No password or plain data is stored anywhere

### 4. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration (Optional)**  
- Proves facts without revealing sensitive data  
- Example:  
  > "This user can repay five $200 installments"  
  > without showing actual transaction details  
- Tools: `Noir`, `snarkjs`, `zk-kit`, `Circom`
